///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Please note that the following descriptions are mainly for older version.
Descriptions for current version is under construction.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////



0. Requirement

+ Operating System
  The code was tested under Windows 7 x64.
  The code may work under other operating system.

+ Matlab
  In order to run the code on Matlab, three toolbox will be required; 
  Image Processing Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, and Optimization Toolbox. 
  Version R2017a and later will work. 
  If you want to build package from these code, Matlab Compiler will be required.

+ Intel C++ compiler
  We tested version 14.0 for windows.
  Other version may work.


1. Install Matlab

Follow the instructions from MathWorks.


2. Install Fiji

Download Fiji (Life-Line version, 2013 July 15) for appropriate operating system from web 
(http://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads) and decompress it.
Add (FIJI_INSTALL_DIR)/scripts to the matlab search path.
Copy lib/MorphoLibJ-1.0.7.jar and src/java_sources/roiedit3d_subclass.jar to
(FIJI_INSTALL_DIR)/plugins.
MorphoLibJ is also available from github (https://github.com/ijpb/MorphoLibJ/releases).


3. Install minmaxfilt

Decompress lib/MinMaxFilterFolder.zip and run minmaxfilter_install.m in Matlab,
then the inner functions will be compiled as mex functions.
Copy mex version of lemire_nd_maxengine and lemire_nd_minengine to the source directory (src/).
MinMaxFilter is also available from matlab file exchange
(http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24705-min-max-filter).


4. Compile and link for elipsoid_em_*.cpp

Because the code includes instructions for intel C++ compiler, matlab cannot compile it.
If you do not have the compiler, src/elipsoid_em_12.mexw64 may work for Windows environment.
If you have the compiler, the following command will work for Linux.
Compile command:

icc -c elipsoid_em_12.cpp -DMKL_ILP64 -fPIC -debug expr-source-pos -ftz -xHost -I$MATLAB_ROOT/extern/include -I$MKLROOT/include -O3 -fp-model fast=2 -DNDEBUG -opt-matmul -axAVX -static -openmp-stubs

Link command:

icc -o elipsoid_em_12.mexa64 elipsoid_em_12.o -shared -L$MATLAB_ROOT/bin/glnxa64 -L$MKLROOT/lib/intel64 -lmx -lmex -lmat -lut -lstdc++ -Wl,--start-group ${MKLROOT}/lib/intel64/libmkl_intel_ilp64.a ${MKLROOT}/lib/intel64/libmkl_core.a ${MKLROOT}/lib/intel64/libmkl_intel_thread.a -Wl,--end-group -lpthread -lm

where MATLAB_ROOT is an environment variable (the path for the matlab install directory).
Then copy elipsoid_em_12.mexa64 to the source directry (src/).


5. Locate guava 

Although RoiEdit3D uses guava (java library from google), matlab loads the old version 
of the library (google-collect.jar) from static path.
In order to put the guava library on the top of the static path, copy src/javaclasspath.txt
to MATLAB_PREF_DIR.
MATLAB_PREF_DIR can be found by running prefdir function in Matlab command window.
Then copy src/guava-18.0.jar to $matlabroot/3rd_party/ and restart matlab.


6. Run the code

Here we can run src/roiedit3d_25_16.m from Matlab.
Please note that the code modifies some settings for java in Matlab 
including java.opts (for memory) and javaclasspath (for guava library).


7. Build exectable (optional)

By using matlab compiler, the matlab codes and relevant libraries are encrypted and 
packed as a standalone exectable package.
The package will work without matlab license and requires matlab compiler runtime 
(available with no cost).

To build the package for roiedit3d_25_16, run followings in Matlab command window;

mcc('-m','roiedit3d_25_16.m','-a',fileparts(fileparts(which('Miji'))),...
'-a','atlas_20181230_White=1_MaskPha=1_RemoveHYP=1.mat','-a','reference.mat','-a','guava-18.0.jar',...
'-a','java.opts','-a','javaclasspath.txt','-a','peak_detection_14_param_for_*.txt',...
'-a','merge_emtrace_white.mat','-a','visualize_promoter_expression.mat',...
'-a','geneIDs.csv');
